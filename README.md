# Goschulte (work in progress)

**Schulte tables using Go and TailwindCSS**

Schulte tables are a type of visual search exercise that can help to improve
your reading speed, attention, and peripheral vision. They consist of a grid of
numbers or letters that are arranged in random order. The goal is to find each
number or letter in the grid, starting from the top left and moving down and to
the right, as quickly as possible.

## Local Development

To use this project locally, you need to have **Go** installed. The project
also uses **TailwindCSS**, but you don't need to have it installed if you don't
intend to modify the CSS - the built CSS is already included in the source
code.
