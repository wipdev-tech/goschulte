**Schulte tables using Go and TailwindCSS**

Schulte tables are a type of visual search exercise that can help to improve
your reading speed, attention, and peripheral vision. They consist of a grid of
numbers that are arranged in random order. The goal is to find all the numbers
in the grid, as quickly as possible, while focusing on the center of the table.

(Render.com shuts down deployments on the free tier so first load might take
some time.)

## Local Development

To use this project locally, you need to have **Go** installed. The project
also uses **TailwindCSS**, but you don't need to have it installed if you don't
intend to modify the CSS - the built CSS is already included in the source
code.
